# thgw-GNU-Emacs-profile

My personal GNU Emacs profile for Clojure development.

I work with only the necessary packages: Paredit, Aggressive Indent, Clojure, Cider, and Company for completion.

Works on Linux and Windows.

- Put the init.el file in .emacs.d/ (.d is for directory...)
- On Windows, the .emacs.d/ is found by default in C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming, which can be found in Explorer by typing %AppData% in the address bar.
