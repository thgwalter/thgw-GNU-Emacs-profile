# thgw-GNU-Emacs-profile

My personal GNU Emacs profile for Clojure development.

I work with only the necessary packages: Paredit, Aggressive Indent, Clojure, Cider, and Company for completion.

Works on Linux and Windows. Not tested elsewhere.

## Updates from 2023

- The .emacs file is deprecated (5 years old) but left it as an historical reference of my journey in Emacs and Clojure.
- Just use the init.el file in .emacs.d/ (.d is for directory...)
- On Windows, the .emacs.d/ is found by default in C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming, which can be found in Explorer by typing %AppData% in the address bar.
- I added some packages obviously but the core remains the same.
